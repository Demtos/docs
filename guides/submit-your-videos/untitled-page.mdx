Demtos Clip allows you to submit videos in two ways:

- **Local upload** – upload a video file directly from your device
- **YouTube link** – paste a YouTube video URL to process it automatically

This makes it easy to clip sermons whether they are stored locally or already published on YouTube.

For best results, use videos with clear audio and minimal background noise.
