## What is Demtos Clip?

Demtos Clip is an AI-powered tool built to help churches and ministries turn long-form sermons and messages into short, shareable video clips.

Instead of manually watching and editing hours of video, Demtos Clip automatically identifies key moments from your content and generates clips optimized for social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

Demtos Clip is designed to be simple and easy to use — no video editing skills required.

Its goal is to help churches save time, stay consistent online, and extend the reach of their message beyond the church walls.
